A simple Python command-line to-do list application that allows users to add, remove, and mark tasks as completed. Tasks are saved to a file for persistence across sessions.

Features
Add a Task: Add new tasks to your to-do list.
Remove a Task: Remove tasks by selecting the task number.
View Tasks: View all your tasks along with their completion status.
Mark Task as Completed: Mark a task as completed (checked off).
Persistence: Tasks are saved to a file (tasks.txt) and will persist between program runs.
Requirements
Python 3.x or later (no external libraries required).
Getting Started
Clone or Download the Repository
Clone the repository or download the todo_list.py file to your local machine.
Running the Program
Make sure Python 3.x is installed on your system.

Open a terminal (or command prompt) and navigate to the directory containing the todo_list.py file.

Run the program by typing the following command:

bash
Copy code
python todo_list.py
The application will display a menu with the following options:

1. Add Task: Allows you to add a new task to your to-do list.
2. Remove Task: Allows you to remove a task by entering its number.
3. View Tasks: Displays all tasks along with their completion status.
4. Mark Task as Completed: Allows you to mark a task as completed.
5. Exit: Exits the application, saving your tasks to the tasks.txt file.
File Persistence
All tasks are stored in a file called tasks.txt.
The file is automatically created in the same directory where the script is located if it doesn't already exist.
Each time the program runs, tasks are loaded from this file. Any changes you make (adding, removing, or completing tasks) will be saved back to the file when you exit the program.
Example Usage
After running the program, you will see a menu like this:

Troubleshooting
Problem: The program doesn't run or gives an error about Python not being found.
Solution: Make sure Python is installed correctly. You can check your Python version by running python --version or python3 --version in your terminal.
Problem: The program doesn't save tasks.
Solution: Ensure that you have write permissions in the directory where the script is running, so it can save tasks.txt.
